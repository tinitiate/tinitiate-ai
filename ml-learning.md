## Semi-supervised learning
* Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm that sits between supervised and unsupervised learning, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy. * This approach is particularly valuable when acquiring a large set of labeled data is costly or impractical, but obtaining unlabeled data is relatively easy.
*Labeled and Unlabeled Data:
  * Labeled Data: Small amount of data that includes the input along with the corresponding output label. It's expensive or time-consuming to obtain.
  * Unlabeled Data: Larger set of data that consists of inputs without labeled outputs. It's usually cheaper and more abundantly available.
* Learning Strategies: SSL employs several strategies to utilize both types of data effectively:
  * Self-training: The model is first trained with a small amount of labeled data, then it predicts labels for the unlabeled data. The most confident predictions are added to the training set as if they were true labels.
  * Co-training: Two models are trained separately on different views of the data (different sets of features). Each model then labels unlabeled data for the other to train on, iteratively improving each other.
  * Transductive learning: The model tries to predict the labels for the specific set of unlabeled data included in training, rather than generalizing to all possible inputs.
  * Graph-based methods: These methods construct a graph where nodes represent both labeled and unlabeled points, and edges represent similarity between points. The learning process then involves propagating labels through the graph.

* Applications: SSL is used in various fields such as:
  * Image recognition: Where labeling is resource-intensive, SSL can use unlabeled images to improve recognition accuracy.
  * Text classification: SSL can help in scenarios where labeled documents are limited.
  * Bioinformatics: Where experimental data may be limited or expensive to obtain.

* Advantages and Challenges
  * Advantages:
    * Efficiency: Reduces the need for large labeled datasets, cutting down the time and cost of data collection.
    * Improved accuracy: Incorporates more data into the model, potentially leading to better generalization on unseen data.
  * Challenges:
    * Dependency on assumptions: The effectiveness of SSL often depends on assumptions about how the labeled and unlabeled data are related (e.g., cluster assumption, manifold assumption).
    * Model complexity: The methods can be more complex and computationally expensive than supervised or unsupervised learning alone.
    * Risk of propagation error: Incorrect labels generated by the model can be propagated through the learning process, leading to decreased accuracy.
